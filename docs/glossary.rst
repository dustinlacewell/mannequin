    package
        A Python package is a module defined by a directory, containing
        a ``__init__.py`` file, and can contain other modules or other
        packages within it.

                __init__.py

    declarative programming
        In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm
        that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its
        control flow. Many languages applying this style attempt to
        minimize or eliminate side effects by describing what the program
        should accomplish, rather than describing how to go about
        accomplishing it (the how is left up to the language's
        implementation). This is in contrast with imperative programming, in
        which algorithms are implemented in terms of explicit steps.
